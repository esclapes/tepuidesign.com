            <title>2009 Year in Review for IBI</title>
            <link>https://tepuidesign.com/blog/2009-year-review-ibi</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Biochar Initiative has gone from strength to strength in the past
                year, and TEPUI are delighted to see (and occasionally contribute to) that progress. They have just
                released their 2009 Review, and I have included it in this post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can see the
                potential for this highly scalable technology for rebuilding soil productivity while sequestering
                significant amounts of carbon, then consider helping out IBI with a membership. Links for all that and
                more are in the review text which follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;IBI
                has achieved some major milestones in 2009 that we are proud to share.
                Organizationally, we grew from two part-time staff members in 2008 to
                six at the end of 2009. We began the process of expanding our &lt;a

                target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;board&lt;/a&gt;,
                bringing on new board member David Wayne in October. We drafted IBI&#039;s
                first strategic plan and launched a membership program. We convened a
                new &lt;a
                href=&quot;https://org2.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;amp;c=209n1C753%2Fiq3doohQ%2FIVLSdEUS8BodT&quot;
                target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advisory committee&lt;/a&gt; of 39 members from 13 countries to consult on
                all aspects of IBI&#039;s work. Thanks to the hard work of administrative director &lt;a
                href=&quot;https://org2.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;amp;c=ZIfjo5EyhSvwSn3X29DWcrSdEUS8BodT&quot;
                target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lee Parker&lt;/a&gt;,
                we set up all the systems for planning, accounting and reporting that a
                non-profit organization needs in support of the IBI programs that we
                are developing to serve the biochar community. Here are some highlights
                of our program work in 2009:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

            <title>What Is Biochar? A Valuable Soil Amendment </title>
            <link>https://tepuidesign.com/blog/what-biochar-valuable-soil-amendment</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biochar is a fine-grained, highly porous charcoal that helps soils
                retain nutrients and water.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-right
                mceItem&quot; src=&quot;https://www.biochar-international.org/files/graphics/photo2.jpg&quot;
                alt=&quot;Biochar ready to apply&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;15&quot; width=&quot;178&quot;
                height=&quot;235&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Biochar is found in soils
                around the world as a result of vegetation fires and historic soil management practices. Intensive study
                of biochar-rich dark earths in the Amazon (terra preta), has led to a wider appreciation of biocharâ€™s
                unique properties as a soil conditioner. &quot;Biochar can be an important tool to increase sustainable
                food production in areas with severely depleted soils, scarce organic resources, and inadequate water
                and chemical fertilizer supplies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Biochar also improves water quality and
                quantity by increasing soil retention of nutrients and agrochemicals for plant and crop utilization.
                More nutrients stay in the soil instead of leaching into groundwater and causing
                pollution.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a
