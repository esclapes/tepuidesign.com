 <title>sustainability - strategies &amp; design</title>
 <link>https://tepuidesign.com</link>
 <description>Welcome to the Living Economy, the leading edge of a rapidly emerging sector which is defying the recession in its continued growth and development.
 Why? How? Because the thinking, strategies, technologies and people engaging with the Living Economy are restoring biological resources, regenerating communities and repairing the ecological and economic connections which underpin prosperity.
This is the future, and it&#039;s now.</description>

 <title>A Matter of Attitude</title>
 <link>https://tepuidesign.com/content/matter-attitude</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;posterous_autopost&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow on from a few of the previous posts I am re-reading with my coffee (first cup, so allow for that)... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few thoughts on our ability to adopt and adapt new frameworks:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;I think where &lt;em&gt;Biomimicry&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Systems Thinking&lt;/em&gt; will fall down is precisely where we try to use them as &#039;replacement&#039;  constructs for a manipulative engineering strategy in a similarly  limited perspective to the tactics now failing us: in other words,  incomplete integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;posterous_autopost&quot;&gt;We need to consider not only how to change our technologies and  policies, but equally when a tech solution is appropriate versus when we  need to rethink the larger presumptions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mceItem&quot; src=&quot;/sites/tepuidesign.com/files/u3/FLOAT-Amphibious-Villa-de-Hoef.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;206&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;posterous_autopost&quot;&gt;Let&#039;s take an example from the early 2011 season of massive floods which  have literally deluged every inhabited continent. Obviously rescue and  relief come first, but the situation has also inspired a burst of  creative responses from the planning and design side of things: floating  houses (such as the work of Koen Olthuis and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waterstudio.nl/&quot;&gt;Waterstudio&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands) , even floating communities and entire cities (such as this proposal for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aila.org.au/sea-change/slides/009.htm&quot;&gt;Embassy of the Drowned Nations&lt;/a&gt;) are predicted for the future.&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Bringing Back the Reefs</title>
 <link>https://tepuidesign.com/content/bringing-back-reefs</link>
 <description>&lt;strong&gt;One of the unfortunate &quot;Poster Boys&quot; for climate chaos has been coral bleaching, the worldwide die-off or coral reefs, and attendant loss of biodiversity, fisheries, and livelihoods.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mceItem&quot; src=&quot;/sites/tepuidesign.com/files/u3/coral_bleached.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;259&quot; height=&quot;194&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Bleaching occurs when stress causes corals to expel symbiotic algae. Several factors can cause bleaching, but, according to Mark Eakin, coordinator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#039;s Coral Reef Watch, the only thing that could cause mass bleaching on this geographical scale is high temperatures maintained over a period of months. &quot;There is some evidence that local factors and other climate-scale factors, such as ocean acidification, sea-level rise and changes in storm intensity, may influence bleaching sensitivity,&quot; he says. &quot;But temperature is the big driver.&quot; (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/2010/101119/full/news.2010.621.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nature&lt;/strong&gt; 19 November 2010, Coral bleaching goes from bad to worse&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tepuidesign.com/content/bringing-back-reefs&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Certificate in Sustainable Design Innovation - Ireland </title>
 <link>https://tepuidesign.com/blog/ireland-certificate-sustainable-design</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;floatleft mceItem&quot; src=&quot;../../sites/tepuidesign.com/files/u3/spark.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;151&quot; width=&quot;211&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TEPUI has co-developed with IT Carlow
and the Design Ireland Skillnet &lt;strong&gt;a certificate course in Sustainable Design Innovation&lt;/strong&gt;.
This module has now been accredited as an ECTS 10 credit Level 9 module (post-
Masters Degree) by the Irish Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 15-week course ran for two
consecutive years, with students coming from a variety of
backgrounds, most being mid-career professionals. They included
architects, landscape designers, graphic designers, fashion
designers, industrial materials designers, planners, industrial
product designers, design managers, marketing managers and other
business managers with responsibility for new product development
(NPD), company strategy and design. In other words, representation
was broad, and this served to enrich the exchange of ideas and
experiences in the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008/2009 and 2009/2010, the program consisted of........................&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tepuidesign.com/blog/ireland-certificate-sustainable-design&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>2009 Year in Review for IBI</title>
 <link>https://tepuidesign.com/blog/2009-year-review-ibi</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Biochar Initiative has gone from strength to strength in the past year, and TEPUI are delighted to see (and occasionally contribute to) that progress. They have just released their 2009 Review, and I have included it in this post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can see the potential for this highly scalable technology for rebuilding soil productivity while sequestering significant amounts of carbon, then consider helping out IBI with a membership. Links for all that and more are in the review text which follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;IBI
has achieved some major milestones in 2009 that we are proud to share.
Organizationally, we grew from two part-time staff members in 2008 to
six at the end of 2009. We began the process of expanding our &lt;a href=&quot;https://org2.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;amp;c=kHoY0h2qqATuos0cpW7i9LSdEUS8BodT&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;board&lt;/a&gt;,
bringing on new board member David Wayne in October. We drafted IBI&#039;s
first strategic plan and launched a membership program. We convened a
new &lt;a href=&quot;https://org2.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;amp;c=209n1C753%2Fiq3doohQ%2FIVLSdEUS8BodT&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advisory committee&lt;/a&gt; of 39 members from 13 countries to consult on all aspects of IBI&#039;s work. Thanks to the hard work of administrative director &lt;a href=&quot;https://org2.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;amp;c=ZIfjo5EyhSvwSn3X29DWcrSdEUS8BodT&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lee Parker&lt;/a&gt;,
we set up all the systems for planning, accounting and reporting that a
non-profit organization needs in support of the IBI programs that we
are developing to serve the biochar community. Here are some highlights
of our program work in 2009:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tepuidesign.com/blog/2009-year-review-ibi&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Are humans creative enough for the coming future?</title>
 <link>https://tepuidesign.com/blog/are-humans-creative-enough-coming-future</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am completely sure we are born creative, otherwise we would have not arrived this far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However I am also convinced that our mainstream education systems are killing this gift. We are taught to be afraid of mistake, and to do everything according to tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are big changes coming in the next few years: oil and other mineral resources are peaking, and climate change might reach a tipping point soon. In that scenario, our books and university degrees might not suit our needs, and we will need our creativity back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&amp;nbsp;Sir Ken Robinson, for pointing this out at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/&quot;&gt;TED talks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; data=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/v/iG9CE55wbtY&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;data&quot; value=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/v/iG9CE55wbtY&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;src&quot; value=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/v/iG9CE55wbtY&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tepuidesign.com/blog/are-humans-creative-enough-coming-future&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>What Is Biochar? A Valuable Soil Amendment </title>
 <link>https://tepuidesign.com/blog/what-biochar-valuable-soil-amendment</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biochar is a fine-grained, highly porous charcoal that helps soils retain nutrients and water.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-right mceItem&quot; src=&quot;https://www.biochar-international.org/files/graphics/photo2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Biochar ready to apply&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;15&quot; width=&quot;178&quot; height=&quot;235&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Biochar is found in soils around the world as a result of vegetation fires and historic soil management practices. Intensive study of biochar-rich dark earths in the Amazon (terra preta), has led to a wider appreciation of biochar’s unique properties as a soil conditioner. &quot;Biochar can be an important tool to increase sustainable food production in areas with severely depleted soils, scarce organic resources, and inadequate water and chemical fertilizer supplies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Biochar also improves water quality and quantity by increasing soil retention of nutrients and agrochemicals for plant and crop utilization. More nutrients stay in the soil instead of leaching into groundwater and causing pollution.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tepuidesign.com/blog/what-biochar-valuable-soil-amendment&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Biochar for Environmental Management -  Book Review</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;There is one way we could 	save ourselves...&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; In a recent interview in New Scientist James Lovelock, originator of the Gaia theory, cited biochar as the one chance we have left to save humankind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the long-awaited “biochar bible” has been published. I have been reading and reviewing Lehmann and Joseph’s textbook on biochar for the past month, and I am thoroughly impressed.

 <title>Probortunities: A Way Out of the Crisis</title>
 <link>https://tepuidesign.com/content/probortunities-way-out-crisis</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;
(This article was originally oublished in the March 2009 issue of HLI,&lt;strong&gt; Horticulture and Landscape Ireland&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic bubble has burst, bringing an avalanche of crises with it. We have peaked not just the global oil reserves, but most reserves of industrial metals, clean water, soil fertility and biodiversity. Innovation and critical thinking, as well as leadership have slipped from our cultural vocabulary after decades of self centred gorging within that bubble economy. To come through this will challenge all of our individual and collective abilities.&amp;nbsp; But, I believe we have three or four fairly “easy” (or at least obvious) avenues to explore, building upon a combination of the strengths and orientation of our sector, and the needs of our time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tepuidesign.com/content/probortunities-way-out-crisis&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
