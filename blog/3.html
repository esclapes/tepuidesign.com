                  <p>To follow on from a few of the previous posts I am re-reading with my coffee (first cup, so allow
                    for that)... </p>
                  <p>A few thoughts on our ability to adopt and adapt new frameworks:<br />&nbsp;<br />I think where
                    <em>Biomimicry</em> and <em>Systems Thinking</em> will fall down is precisely where we try to use
                    them as 'replacement' constructs for a manipulative engineering strategy in a similarly limited
                    perspective to the tactics now failing us: in other words, incomplete integration.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="posterous_autopost">We need to consider not only how to change our technologies and
                  policies, but equally when a tech solution is appropriate versus when we need to rethink the larger
                  presumptions.</div>
                <p><img class="mceItem" src="../sites/tepuidesign.com/files/u3/FLOAT-Amphibious-Villa-de-Hoef.jpg"
                    alt="" width="300" height="206" /></p>
                <div class="posterous_autopost">Let's take an example from the early 2011 season of massive floods which
                  have literally deluged every inhabited continent. Obviously rescue and relief come first, but the
                  situation has also inspired a burst of creative responses from the planning and design side of things:
                  floating houses (such as the work of Koen Olthuis and <a
                    href="https://www.waterstudio.nl/">Waterstudio</a> in the Netherlands) , even floating communities
                  and entire cities (such as this proposal for an <a
                    href="https://www.aila.org.au/sea-change/slides/009.htm">Embassy of the Drowned Nations</a>) are
                  predicted for the future.</div>
                <p><img class="mceItem" src="../sites/tepuidesign.com/files/u3/embassy-of-the-floating-nations.jpg"
                    alt="" width="300" height="206" /></p>
                <div class="posterous_autopost">I actually like the proposal for the Embassy, it's exactly the sort of
                  poetic, startling and "creatively in-your-face" statement that can profoundly affect awareness.
                  However, and more pragmatically for more continental communities, the flood response might equally
                  include decisions NOT to rebuild, as has happened too infrequently, but there are communities which
                  have responded by relocating. And that is a legitimate solution: change the problem by altering the
                  need itself.</div>
                <div class="posterous_autopost">We need to learn from the integrative qualities of <em>Permaculture,
                    Biomimicry </em>and<em> Systems-Thinking</em> as much as from their specific brilliance. We need to
                  be open to their inspiration and models in a richly diversified cross-linkage of pretty much
                  everything we do, and be open to the idea that various tipping points, pivots, opportunities for
                  transformation and uptake may not necessarily be found in planning, engineering, or industrial design
                  for instance; they may be cultural, personal/psychological, political....</div>

                <div class="posterous_autopost">The cultural (including attitudinal) aspects are so fundamental that we
                  tend to be blind to them within our own circles and societies, only identifying them when they crop up
                  as a barrier to cross-cultural communication.</div>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <div class="posterous_autopost">The cultural (including attitudinal) aspects are so fundamental that we
                  tend to be blind to them within our own circles and societies, only identifying them when they crop up
                  as a barrier to cross-cultural communication. As participants in a highly technological society we
                  tend to take an initial approach to nature and the built environment as 'overcoming' versus
                  'adapting'. I take comfort and strategic guidance from the knowledge that this too is a cultural
                  attitude rather than something hardwired at the species level. Because attitudes can and do change.
                  </p>
                  <p>How can I be so sure this is cultural? From many years of working with various Indigenous
                    communities, in part as an intercultural translator and bridge-builder. In trying to separate the
                    core distinctions which genuinely characterize Indigenous world views from those of industrialized
                    societies, there is a short list which has more or less been agreed by many cultural groups. Key
                    differences include that Indigenous perspective sees the world as alive rather than a set of
                    commodities, it sees humanity in a respectful relationship to the others sharing our world, and the
                    first and preferred response to situations which we would engineer is to adapt to rather than
                    manipulate the system. They also tend to be more aware of, accepting and comfortable with time
                    factors.
                </div>
                <div class="posterous_autopost"><strong><strong>So the fact that there are other cultural perspectives
                      which prefer adaptation over manipulation is encouraging. We don't have to think the ways we
                      currently do. We have choice.</strong></strong></p>
                  <p>We are in the midst of paradigm change. It is messy. All truly creative process is messy.
                    Biomimicry brings biologists to the design table. We also need expertise and perspective from many
                    other disciplines and everyday experiences to be brought into the conversations, and not in a
                    tokenistic "stakeholder consultation", but as authorities on their own understanding. Innovation is
                    more than new ideas and new strategies; it is about new voices.</p>
                  <p>That's more than I thought I was going to say. I think I need another cup of coffee :)

                <strong>One of the unfortunate "Poster Boys" for climate chaos has been coral bleaching, the worldwide
                  die-off or coral reefs, and attendant loss of biodiversity, fisheries, and livelihoods.<p><strong><img
                        class="mceItem" src="../sites/tepuidesign.com/files/u3/coral_bleached.jpg" alt="" width="259"
                        height="194"></strong></p> </strong>Bleaching occurs when stress causes corals to expel
                symbiotic algae. Several factors can cause bleaching, but, according to Mark Eakin, coordinator of the
                US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coral Reef Watch, the only thing that could cause
                mass bleaching on this geographical scale is high temperatures maintained over a period of months.
                "There is some evidence that local factors and other climate-scale factors, such as ocean acidification,
                sea-level rise and changes in storm intensity, may influence bleaching sensitivity," he says. "But
                temperature is the big driver." (See <a
                  href="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/101119/full/news.2010.621.html"
                  target="_blank"><strong>Nature</strong> 19 November 2010, Coral bleaching goes from bad to worse</a> )
                <p></p> Now under intense and unrelenting stress from environmental changes, those reefs retaining any
                semblance of their former health and diversity are perversely becoming victims of their own survival as
                underwater tourists concentrate around them. (I actually wrote about a related issue back in the days
                before blogs: western conservation strategies which create parks and reserves as islands of wildness ---
                and thus magnets for Nature-starved millions who essentially "pet them to death").<p>&nbsp;</p> Like
                many of the other positive stories ignored by mainstream media, the combined focus of artists,
                biologists and business (tourism in this case) can come up with some effective responses. We should all
                take heart, because rather than leaving the case of the corals to advocacy and pressure groups, others
                have begun to (literally) jump in and get to work with reconstruction and restoration. Not surprisingly,
                these include gardeners.<p>&nbsp;</p> <object width="500" height="300"

                  for Conservation</a> program was first initiated in 1999 in Fiji, as ”The Coral Gardens Initiative”.
                The program focuses at restoring degraded coral reef ecosystems by working in partnership with marine
                resource owners to develop community-based marine management plans and to implement strategies to
                rectify problems such as over-fishing and coral reef decline.The program started in Fiji under the name
                “The Coral Gardens-Living Reefs Initiative”.&nbsp; In 2008 work was ongoing in five district level
                sites.&nbsp; The work has been extended to Samoa and the Caribbean using donor funding.&nbsp; New
                countries and sites within a country can be added, as long as there is strong local support and donor
                funds can be found. <p>&nbsp;</p>See what I mean? Twelve years in operation and largely ignored by the

                    Armstrong</strong></a> with metabolic materials and limestone formation (but much earlier), the
                process of Electrodeposition of Minerals in Sea Water known as Mineral Accretion Technology was
                developed by Architect, Marine Scientist, <strong>Prof.&nbsp;Wolf&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hilbertz</strong>.
                Through extensive experimental applications, demonstration projects commenced in 1974, covering
                artificial reefs, coastal defense structures, shoreline stabilization - erosion control, mariculture,
                and marine construction.Although initially developed for structural applications, exceptional
                accumulations and growth rates of marine organisms on accreting structures were observed. The process
                was further developed as<strong> <a href="https://www.biorock.net/Technologies/">Biorock</a></strong>,
                where electric currents running through purpose-built steel frameworks speed up the rate of
                recolonization several fold. <p>&nbsp;</p>Prof. Hibertz and Biorock have made impressive and in my
                opinion, phenomenally encouraging work in Bali, where the combination of local fisheries and tourism
                have started to recover from what seemed an inevitable collapse as the reefs were dying a relatively
                short while ago. His project is by no means secure, nor are the reefs and the communities which depend
                upon their health, but he has developed and demonstrated a vital and straightforward technology for
                restoration of some of Earth's most important habitats. Biorock deserves far more attention and support,
                and it needs to go mainstream now.<strong>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p> Still other, and obvious/inspiring coral recovery linked to tourism is a joint Jordanian
                  - Israeli venture (already notable just at that) to establish new artificial reef bases
                </strong>in the Gulf of Aqaba, which lies at the northern end of the Red Sea and is bordered by both
                Israel and Jordan as well as Egypt and Saudia Arabia farther south. A 1994 peace deal between Israel and
                Jordan mandated that the two countries work together on combating marine pollution, natural resources
                issues, and coastal reef protection in the gulf. <p><img class="mceItem"

                <p>&nbsp;</p>These reefs draw tourists from around the world to the neighboring resort cities of Elat,
                Israel, and Al 'Aqabah, Jordan. And as elsewhere, more tourism and less reef creates a perfect formula
                for "suffocation via love". The artificial reefs are part of a response which will provide divers more
                places to visit, and eventually will support new coral growth and and extension of the natural reef
                system. (See more : <a

                fusion of art and conservation, more than 400 permanent sculptures have been installed in recent months
                in the National Marine Park of Cancún, Isla Mujeres, and Punta Nizuc as part of a major artwork called
                "The Silent Evolution." The installation is the first endeavor of a new underwater museum called MUSA,
                or<strong> </strong><strong><a title="Museo Subacuático de Arte." href="https://www.musacancun.com/"

                <p>The statues are made from a special marine-grade concrete which is not only stable in salt water, but

                  square feet (420 square meters), which would make it "one of the largest and most ambitious underwater
                  attractions in the world," achieve some relief from the approximately 750,000 tourists who visit local

                Going beyond "biomimicry" and "bioinspiration", cutting edge research into "metabolic materials" has
                developed pseudo-cells whose behavior is animate, responsive, and constructive. In this short talk given
                by Rachel Armstrong for <strong><a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/rachel_armstrong.html">TED
                    Talks</a></strong>, she discusses how a new species of synthetic "cells" have been developed to fix
                carbon as a very familiar material: limestone. Wait. You just have to watch and see for yourself.<p>
                  &nbsp;</p> EN: Venice is sinking. To save it, Rachel Armstrong says we need to outgrow architecture
                made of inert materials and, well, make architecture that grows itself. She proposes a not-quite-alive
                material that does its own repairs and sequesters carbon, too.<p>&nbsp;</p>ES: Venecia, en Italia, se

                <p><strong>Metabolic Materials</strong>: Rachel Armstrong's hope is that, in the future, cities will be
                  able to replace the energy they draw from the environment, respond to the needs of their populations
                  and eventually become regarded as "alive" -- in the same way we think about parks or gardens. Since
                  "metabolic materials" are made from terrestrial chemistry, they would not be exclusive to the
                  developed world, and would have the potential to transform urban environments worldwide.</p>
                <p><strong>Multifaceted: </strong>A medical doctor, multi-media producer, science fiction author and
                  arts collaborator. Rachel's current research explores architectural design and mythologies about new
                  technology. She is working with scientists and architects to explore cutting-edge, sustainable
                  technologies. Like and unlike the work of <strong><a
                      href="https://www.underwatersculpture.com/index.asp">Jason de Caires Taylor</a></strong>, Rachel
                  combines art with conservation in a way which is practical, inspired and seems obvious....but only
                  after the fact - -&nbsp; leaving a smile, a sense of wonder, and the question, "now why didn't anyone
                  think of that before?"</p> "Scientists need to work outside their own areas of expertise to make new
                technologies that are pertinent to the 21st century and to collaborate, both with other scientific
                disciplines and the arts and humanities."<br>Rachel Armstrong

                <p>TEPUI has co-developed with IT Carlow
                  and the Design Ireland Skillnet <strong>a certificate course in Sustainable Design
                    Innovation</strong>.
                  This module has now been accredited as an ECTS 10 credit Level 9 module (post-
                  Masters Degree) by the Irish Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC.

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>This 15-week course ran for two
                  consecutive years, with students coming from a variety of
                  backgrounds, most being mid-career professionals. They included
                  architects, landscape designers, graphic designers, fashion
                  designers, industrial materials designers, planners, industrial
                  product designers, design managers, marketing managers and other
                  business managers with responsibility for new product development
                  (NPD), company strategy and design. In other words, representation
                  was broad, and this served to enrich the exchange of ideas and
                  experiences in the class.</p>

                  <li>This course is not about the plethora
                    of 'Post -It' type solutions available today, It is about fundamental
                    philosophy and knowledge to see through the volumes of misinformation
                    and dubious solutions used to 'Greenwash' products , processes and

                  <li>There are so many buzz words around
                    sustainability these days. A course like this goes back to first
                    principles and gives foundation to an understanding of what they
                    actually mean and represent. Putting the theory into practice is the
                    place that a course like this can be a catalyst for any person across
                    different disciplines.<strong>- Patrick Shaffery (Architect)</strong></li>

                    say that sustainability is the way of all future living and that it
                    is really important that we get involved now and at all levels. The
                    SDI course is a fantastic course to get you thinking of moving

                <p>A Renewable World: Energy, Ecology, Equality<br>
                  <br>
                  by Herbert Girardet and Miguel Mendonca<br>
                  <br>
                  The post-Copenhagen world requires a fresh look at the big picture. In
                  the absence of international agreements, what steps can be taken
                  nationally, regionally and locally to reduce both carbon emissions and
                  carbon concentrations? The former can be achieved through a
                  transformation in energy production, saving and use, and the latter
                  through biological carbon sequestration. This book sets out examples of
                  these strategies, in policy and practice, from around the world. In
                  addition, the essential question of the active participation of all
                  sectors of society in this transformation is considered through
                  examples of existing initiatives, and the wider issue of democratic
                  reform.<br>
                  <br>
                  A Renewable World was developed in conjunction with dozens of world
                  experts and features solutions on renewable energy, biosequestration,
                  energy sufficiency, energy for developing countries, green collar jobs,
                  cities, transport, agriculture and food, regional economies, and civil
                  participation and democracy. It seeks to clarify what can be done, and
                  how we can all benefit, long into the future.<br>

                  say proportionate, I mean: it tells us how to solve the problem we

                  are developing to serve the biochar community. Here are some highlights
                  of our program work in 2009:</p>

                <p>Objective:
                  To support the development of a knowledge base on biochar

                  <strong>"Biochar Standards</strong>
                  - Starting at the May 2009 Asia Pacific Biochar Conference in Australia
                  and continuing to the North American Biochar Initiative conference in
                  the USA, IBI initiated a <a

                  that will develop a definition of biochar and a classification scheme
                  across feedstocks, production systems and applications. This work will
                  become a major IBI focus in 2010.</p>

                  biochar research projects and papers and made numerous presentations at
                  scientific meetings and conferences. </p>

                  hosted a side event at the UNCCD (UN Convention to Combat
                  Desertification) COP9 in Buenos Aires in September. As a result of our
                  joint work with UNCCD, 16 countries and the UNCCD Secretariat itself
                  have made submissions to the UNFCCC to include biochar in the
                  negotiating text for the next climate agreement. At COP15 in <a

                  the IBI delegation hosted one side event and participated in several
                  others concerning biochar, marking a new high point of interest in
                  biochar as a climate solution. IBI also continued to educate delegates,
                  high-ranking government officials, non-governmental environmental
                  groups and other conference observers of the benefits of biochar at the
                  COP15, and held several meetings with the biochar community, bringing
                  together interested parties from multiple backgrounds. IBI has also
                  secured UNFCCC credentials as a observer group to the Convention,
                  assuring us a seat at the table as climate negotiations continue.</p>

                  to a wider appreciation of biochar’s unique properties as a soil conditioner. "Biochar can be an
                  important tool to increase sustainable food production in areas with severely depleted soils, scarce
                  organic resources, and inadequate water and chemical fertilizer supplies.</p>
                <p>"Biochar also improves water quality and quantity by increasing soil retention of nutrients and
                  agrochemicals for plant and crop utilization. More nutrients stay in the soil instead of leaching into
                  groundwater and causing pollution.</p>
                <p>"The carbon in biochar resists degradation and can sequester carbon in soils for&nbsp; hundreds to
                  thousands of years. Biochar is produced through pyrolysis or gasification — processes that heat
                  biomass in the absence (or under reduction) of air.</p>

                <p>"Oils and gases co-produced with biochar, in well-designed pyrolysis or gasification equipment, can
                  be used as fuel, providing clean, renewable energy. When the biochar is buried in the ground as a soil
                  amendment, the system can become "carbon negative."</p>
                <p>"Biochar and bioenergy co-production can help combat global climate change by displacing fossil fuel
                  use and by sequestering carbon in stable soil carbon pools. It may also reduce emissions of nitrous
                  oxide.</p>
                <p>"In the next few decades, the use of biochar should be able to offset carbon emissions by 1 gigaton
                  per year — an amount which could increase in subsequent years."</p>

                <p><strong>"There is one way we could save ourselves..."</strong>&nbsp;<br> In a recent interview in New
                  Scientist James Lovelock, originator of the Gaia theory, cited biochar as the one chance we have left
                  to save humankind.</p>

                <p>Finally, the long-awaited “biochar bible” has been published. I have been reading and reviewing
                  Lehmann and Joseph’s textbook on biochar for the past month, and I am thoroughly impressed. The edited
                  collection of articles treads the difficult line between technical terminology and layperson’s
                  vocabulary without losing any scientific rigor or lapsing into exclusionary jargon. <a

                    target="_blank">Biochar for Environmental Management</a> covers engineering, environmental sciences,
                  agricultural sciences, economics and policy.</p>
                <p>This is a very readable and well organized, up to the minute introduction to the world of biochar.
                  You could teach a full course out of this book, or excerpt discussions and details to backup your own
                  presentations to policy makers, businesses, farmers and community groups.</p>
                <p>I have a few personal tests for the usability and appeal of a new book, akin to the “can’t put it
                  down” test. I fully admit a certain nerd-like orientation when it comes to the biosphere, living
                  systems, restoration ecology and climate change so when a book becomes a constant companion at bedside
                  and breakfast table, it wins points. The fact that the information is organized so I can open to
                  chapters at random and eventually get the full picture, or read more conventionally from start to
                  finish tells me that the narrative is well conceived and the information presented holistically. I
                  like that about a book, and the information landscape covered is thorough enough to justify all 384
                  pages. When plopped onto a desk, this gives the book the sort of gravitas that immediately commands
                  respect.</p>

                <p><strong>About Biochar:</strong><br><br>”Biochar is the carbon-rich product when biomass (such as
                  wood, manure or crop residues) is heated in a closed container with little or no available air. It can
                  be used to improve agriculture and the environment in several ways, and its stability in soil and
                  superior nutrient-retention properties make it an ideal soil amendment to increase crop yields. In
                  addition to this, biochar sequestration, in combination with sustainable biomass production, can be
                  carbon-negative and therefore used to actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, with major
                  implications for mitigation of climate change. Biochar production can also be combined with bioenergy
                  production through the use of the gases that are given off in the pyrolysis process”.

                <p>
                  (This article was originally oublished in the March 2009 issue of HLI,<strong> Horticulture and
                    Landscape Ireland</strong>)</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The economic bubble has burst, bringing an avalanche of crises with it. We have peaked not just the
                  global oil reserves, but most reserves of industrial metals, clean water, soil fertility and
                  biodiversity. Innovation and critical thinking, as well as leadership have slipped from our cultural
                  vocabulary after decades of self centred gorging within that bubble economy. To come through this will
                  challenge all of our individual and collective abilities.&nbsp; But, I believe we have three or four
                  fairly “easy” (or at least obvious) avenues to explore, building upon a combination of the strengths
                  and orientation of our sector, and the needs of our time. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Rummaging through our collective toolbox of skills, perceptions and material resources, one of the
                  first things to surface is design. Design is both process and product closely related to strategy and
                  vision, both of which are desperately needed to find a way forward and out of the mess. We need to
                  look at our options and needs through the lens of design, open to new possibilities and start thinking
                  outside the box. If we rigorously apply the process, make it second nature, we will open new
                  directions. <br><br>Looking on in exasperation as leadership flounders in the face of a global
                  meltdown, I am thinking of ways to repackage my strategic and design insights to provide support and
                  training for leaders. If we took this up as a challenge to our industry, I foresee localised teams of
                  design consultants coming on to boards and committees at many levels, facilitating the development of
                  sustainability visions and plans to achieve them&nbsp; I would be delighted to talk with any other
                  design strategists who get my point and are ready for action.<br><br>We already work with living
                  organisms and systems in our everyday activity. We understand (even if not always practicing) cycling
                  and conservation of materials, how to grow, the factors of biological productivity. General awareness
                  of all things green has exploded, and despite the recession, there is a genuine desire to maintain the
                  momentum already set in green design, green building, green holidays and more. Climate change, food
                  security, tight budgets: these only serve to underscore the urgency of shifting onto a greener and
                  more sustainable footing. <br><br>Technology development and funding have been increasing steadily in
                  the pursuit of more sustainable options, and at the forefront of this trend is “living technologies”:
                  solutions based upon the natural functioning of living organisms and systems to clean our air, water
                  and soils, to produce energy, to insulate our homes and more. The single economic sector still
                  growing, even now, is “green technologies”, or “clean tech”. With a renewed push to bring down carbon
                  and save energy, clean tech continues to interest investors, and will certainly provide the bones of a
                  new economy. The EU recently committed us to significant reductions in CO2 over the coming decades.
                  Pundits have warned the cost will be in the billions of euros (never mind the cost of non-action
                  becoming incalculable). What seems to slip from the discussion is that every euro spent goes into
                  someone else’s pocket. They represent jobs at a time they are desperately needed. We are already
                  members of a crack team engaged in carbon sequestration for millennia. This is what plants do so well,
                  and we are among those best positioned to fine-tune our activities to fit the (re)newed agenda of
                  slowing climate change.<br><br>Energy audits, energy efficiency, food miles, urban flooding, water
                  conservation…all topping the list of current agenda, and all within our remit. Living roofs and living
                  facades on buildings are big business elsewhere in Europe and the world, as they directly support such
                  agenda. Constructed wetlands, rainwater harvesting, and “biochar” are other green tech solutions which
                  fit well with our sector. <br><br>As fuel costs and the need to reduce emissions conspire to make
                  local food production the most economic option, once again we will be needed to redesign community
                  green spaces, from front gardens to local parks as active components of a local food security
                  strategy. And we know our plants the way nobody else does. We can develop specialty nurseries
                  providing the wealth of edible perennials and woody stock which can be grown in Ireland.<br><br>Our
                  sector holds many of the tools required for this transition; many of the skills can be updated,
                  reshaped, properly positioned and better presented to assume our rightful place within a wider and
                  diverse team.<br><br>We need to convene a national conference on Living Technologies and developing
                  the green sector. Let me know if you’d like to help.<br><br><br>Erik is founder and CEO of TEPUI, a
                  design consortium specializing in living technologies. <br><br>Erik (with Sinead FInn) produced the
                  planning brief for incorporation of green roofs into Dublin's city development plan, is sustainable
                  technologies consultant to the Qatar Foundation's Design Zone project, and teaches Ireland's first
                  Masters level course in Sustainable Design and Innovation. He is a plant explorer, new crops
                  researcher and sometimes orchid breeder.</p>
