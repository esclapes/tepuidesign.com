<p>To follow on from a few of the previous posts I am re-reading with my coffee (first cup, so allow for that)... </p>
<p>A few thoughts on our ability to adopt and adapt new frameworks:<br />&nbsp;<br />I think where <em>Biomimicry</em> and <em>Systems Thinking</em> will fall down is precisely where we try to use them as 'replacement'  constructs for a manipulative engineering strategy in a similarly  limited perspective to the tactics now failing us: in other words,  incomplete integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="posterous_autopost">We need to consider not only how to change our technologies and  policies, but equally when a tech solution is appropriate versus when we  need to rethink the larger presumptions.</div>

<div class="posterous_autopost">Let's take an example from the early 2011 season of massive floods which  have literally deluged every inhabited continent. Obviously rescue and  relief come first, but the situation has also inspired a burst of  creative responses from the planning and design side of things: floating  houses (such as the work of Koen Olthuis and <a href="http://www.waterstudio.nl/">Waterstudio</a> in the Netherlands) , even floating communities and entire cities (such as this proposal for an <a href="http://www.aila.org.au/sea-change/slides/009.htm">Embassy of the Drowned Nations</a>) are predicted for the future.</div>
<p><img class="mceItem" src="../sites/tepuidesign.com/files/u3/embassy-of-the-floating-nations.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="206" /></p>
<div class="posterous_autopost">I actually like the proposal for the Embassy, it's exactly the sort of  poetic, startling and "creatively in-your-face" statement that can  profoundly affect awareness. However, and more pragmatically for more  continental communities, the flood response might equally include  decisions NOT to rebuild, as has happened too infrequently, but there  are communities which have responded by relocating. And that is a  legitimate solution: change the problem by altering the need itself.</div>
<div class="posterous_autopost">We need to learn from the integrative qualities of <em>Permaculture, Biomimicry </em>and<em> Systems-Thinking</em> as much as from their specific brilliance. We need to be open to their  inspiration and models in a richly diversified cross-linkage of pretty  much everything we do, and be open to the idea that various tipping  points, pivots, opportunities for transformation and uptake may not  necessarily be found in planning, engineering, or industrial design for  instance; they may be cultural, personal/psychological, political....</div>
<div class="posterous_autopost"><img class="mceItem" src="../sites/tepuidesign.com/files/u3/PermaculturePrinciples.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="204" /></div>
<div class="posterous_autopost">The cultural (including attitudinal) aspects are so fundamental that we tend to be blind to them within our own circles and societies, only identifying them when they crop up as a barrier to cross-cultural communication.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="posterous_autopost">The cultural (including attitudinal) aspects are so fundamental that we  tend to be blind to them within our own circles and societies, only  identifying them when they crop up as a barrier to cross-cultural  communication. As participants in a highly technological society we tend  to take an initial approach to nature and the built environment as  'overcoming' versus 'adapting'. I take comfort and strategic guidance  from the knowledge that this too is a cultural attitude rather than  something hardwired at the species level. Because attitudes can and do  change. </p>
<p>How can I be so sure this is cultural? From many years  of working with various Indigenous communities, in part as an  intercultural translator and bridge-builder. In trying to separate the  core distinctions which genuinely characterize Indigenous world views  from those of industrialized societies, there is a short list which has  more or less been agreed by many cultural groups. Key differences  include that Indigenous perspective sees the world as alive rather than a  set of commodities, it sees humanity in a respectful relationship to  the others sharing our world, and the first and preferred response to  situations which we would engineer is to adapt to rather than manipulate  the system. They also tend to be more aware of, accepting and  comfortable with time factors.</div>
<div class="posterous_autopost"><strong><strong>So the fact that there are other cultural perspectives which  prefer adaptation over manipulation is encouraging. We don't have to  think the ways we currently do. We have choice.</strong></strong></p>
<p>We are  in the midst of paradigm change. It is messy. All truly creative process  is messy. Biomimicry brings biologists to the design table. We also  need expertise and perspective from many other disciplines and everyday  experiences to be brought into the conversations, and not in a  tokenistic "stakeholder consultation", but as authorities on their own  understanding. Innovation is more than new ideas and new strategies; it  is about new voices.</p>
<p>That's more than I thought I was going to say. I think I need another cup of coffee :)</div>
