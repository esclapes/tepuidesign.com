                A Natural Swimming Pool uses the technology of the reed bed filtration system to cleanse the swimming
                water. Regular swimming pools use chemicals such as chlorine to kill bacteria (which can damage
                swimmersâ€™ health and our ozone system), whereas a natural swimming pool uses the natural purifying
                properties of plants, as well as a small filter to extract surface debris such as leaves, and a small
                pump to keep the water circulating sufficiently through the planting area.
